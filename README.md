# Scala CLI publish test 

This repository serves as an issue reproduction for `scala-cli` not packaging files in `test` directories even when they are not technically tests.

```scala
./package-and-check.sh 
Scala files in current location:
.
â”œâ”€â”€ api.scala
â”œâ”€â”€ api.test.scala
â””â”€â”€ test
    â””â”€â”€ testapi.scala

2 directories, 3 files
